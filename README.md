When the program is run, the user will encounter team and player drop-boxes.
Afterwards, the user will be able to see the point, assist, rebound, block, minutes, steal statistics of this player 
over the years on separate graphs by first selecting the player from behind the team.
Finally, the program provides users with predictive statistics for the next season using the players' statistics from 
the past years.
